        In the early two-thousands, Martin Gurri, a media analyst at the Central
        Intelligence Agency, began considering the political implications of the
        Internet. Gurri worked in the Open Source Center, a part of the C.I.A.
        tasked with analyzing publicly available information, such as
        newspapers, magazines, and reports. With the advent of the Web,
        focussing exclusively on such sources had begun to feel old-fashioned.
        Vast numbers of people were writing online, and the ideas that they
        shared could tank stocks, sway elections, or spark revolutions. “I
        realized that I couldn’t restrict my search for evidence to the familiar
        authoritative sources without ignoring a near-infinite number of new
        sources,” Gurri later wrote. “I was left in a state of uncertainty—a
        permanent condition for analysis under the new dispensation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        2000
        年代初期，任职于中央情报局媒体分析员的马丁·古里开始思考互联网的政治影响。
        古里所在的开放资源中心的任务是分析公开的情报，如报纸、杂志和报告。随着网络的出现，仅依赖这些来源显得过时了。有大量的人在网上写作，他们分享的观点能拉低股价，影响选举，或是引发革命。“我意识到如果只局限于熟悉的权威来源而不顾新的近无限量的信息来源的话，我就无法找到证据，”古里后来写道，“这让我处于一种不确定的状态——在新时代条件下进行分析的一个永久状态。”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parag" :style="{ gridTemplateColumns: gridTemplateColumns }">
      <p>
        In 2014, Gurri described the consequences of this uncertainty in a
        self-published book called “The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of
        Authority.” (An updated edition appeared in 2018.) In the old days, he
        argued, it had been possible to read a newspaper or watch a newscast and
        feel that you’d got a good grasp of “the news.” The Internet, however,
        created the sense that there was always more to know—and this was “an
        acid, corrosive to authority.” Now “every presidential statement, every
        CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper,
        suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral
        predilection rather than intellectual rigor.” Meanwhile, because
        everyone could read only a slice of the Internet, the traditional mass
        audience was splitting into “vital communities”—“groups of wildly
        disparate size gathered organically around a shared interest or theme.”
        These communities, Gurri thought, had a characteristic mood: they
        revelled in the destruction of received opinion and the disassembly of
        arguments from authority. “Every expert is surrounded by a horde of
        amateurs eager to pounce on every mistake and mock every unsuccessful
        prediction or policy,” Gurri wrote. And yet, “the public opposes, but
        does not propose.” Demolishing ideas is easy in a subreddit; crafting
        new ones there is mostly beside the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        2014
        年，古里在一本自出版的书《大众的反抗与权威危机》中描述了这种不确定性的后果（该书在
        2018
        年推出了修订版）。他提出，在过去，人们还可以通过读报纸或看新闻播报来了解时事。然而，互联网却让人总有种感觉，即总有更多的事情需要了解——而这种心态“像酸雨一样侵蚀着权威”。现在，“每一项总统声明、每一次中央情报局评估、每一份著名报纸的调查报告似乎都带有一定的随意性，并且这些都建立在道德偏好之上，而非知识严谨性上。”同时，由于每个人只能接触到互联网的一小部分，传统的大规模受众群体正在分化为“充满活力的社区”——即“围绕共同的兴趣或主题自发聚集起来的不同规模团体”。古里认为，这些社区有着一种典型的情绪：它们乐于颠覆传统观念，拆解权威论证。“每个专家周围都围着一群业余爱好者，急切地抓住每一个错误，嘲笑每一个不成功的预测或政策，”古里写道。然而，“大众反对，但并不提出建议。”在一个
        Reddit 论坛上推翻观点是件容易的事；但在那里创造新的观点却大多无关紧要。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parag" :style="{ gridTemplateColumns: gridTemplateColumns }">
      <p>
        The way those in power responded to these dynamics was troubling. Their
        general strategy, Gurri thought, was to wish that the Internet and its
        “unruly public” would go away, and that the halcyon days of
        authoritative hierarchy would return. Leaders lectured Internet users
        about media literacy and pushed for the tweaking of algorithms. Internet
        users, for their part, grew increasingly uninterested in taking leaders,
        institutions, and experts seriously. For more and more people, a random
        YouTuber seemed preferable to a credentialled expert; anyone
        representing “the system” was intrinsically untrustworthy. As the
        powerful and the public came to regard one another with contempt, they
        created “a perpetual feedback loop of failure and negation,” Gurri
        wrote. Nihilism—“the belief that the status quo is so abhorrent that
        destruction will be a form of progress”—became widespread. It could be
        expressed substantively (say, by rioting in the Capitol) or
        discursively, by asserting your right to say and believe anything you
        want, no matter how absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        掌权者对这些动态的反应令人担忧。在格里看来，他们的总体策略就是希望互联网及其“难对付的公众”消失不见，期盼着权威等级制的黄金时代卷土重来。领导人们开始教导网民如何进行媒介素养，推动改变算法。而网民们则越来越不买这些领导人、机构和专家的账。对于越来越多的人来说，一个随便找来的
        YouTube
        博主似乎都比那些有认证的专家更可信；但凡代表“体制”的人本质上都是不可信的。随着权力阶层与公众之间相互蔑视，他们形成了“一个失败与否定相互强化的恶性循环”，格里写道。虚无主义——“认为现状如此糟糕，以至于破坏现状本身就是一种进步”变得普遍起来。这种情绪可以通过实质行为表达出来（比如冲击国会大厦），也可以通过话语表达出来，即声称你有权说出并相信任何事情，无论它多么荒谬。

        I first read “The Revolt of the Public” in 2016, after Donald Trump won
        the Presidency, because many bloggers I followed described it as
        prescient. I disagreed with Gurri, who has a libertarian sensibility, on
        many points, including the character of the Obama Presidency and the
        nature of the Occupy movement, and felt that the book downplayed the
        degree to which the American left has remained largely allied with its
        institutions while the right has not. But I also found its analysis
        illuminating, and I’ve thought about the book with drumbeat regularity
        ever since. Recently, a friend told me about a relative of his who
        maintained that some public schools had installed “human litter boxes”
        for the convenience of students who “identify as cats.” “How could he
        seriously believe something like that?” my friend asked. Remembering
        Gurri, I wondered if “believing” was the wrong concept to apply to such
        a case. Saying that you believe in human litter boxes might be better
        seen as a way of signalling your rejection of discursive authority. It’s
        like saying, “No one can tell me what to think.”
      </p>
      <p>
        我最初是在2016年唐纳德·特朗普赢得总统大选后读到《公众的反抗》这本书的，因为我关注的一些博主称该书极具先见之明。对于具有自由意志倾向的古里提出的许多观点，包括对奥巴马政府性质和占领运动本质的看法，我都不同意，并且我觉得该书低估了美国左派在多大程度上依然与其体制结盟，而右派却没有这样做。但我也发现该书的分析很有启发性，从那以后，我总是时不时想起这本书。最近，一位朋友告诉我，他的一个亲戚认定某些公立学校为了方便那些“自认为是猫”的学生，安装了“人类便桶”。“他怎么可能真的相信这种事？”我的朋友问道。想到古里的理论，我在想，“相信”也许并不是解释这种情况的正确概念。声称自己相信存在“人类便桶”或许更应该被看作是一种拒绝话语权威的方式。这就像在说：“没人能告诉我该怎么想。”

        How can a society function when the rejection of knowledge becomes a
        political act? Gurri offers a few suggestions, most aimed at healing the
        breach between institutions and the public: government agencies might
        use technology to become more transparent, for example, and
        disillusioned voters might adopt more realistic expectations about how
        much leaders can improve their lives. Yet the main goal of his book
        isn’t to fix the problem (it may not be fixable); he just wants to
        describe it. Short of some new and vast transformation, it’s hard to see
        the Internet becoming a venue for consensus-building; similarly, it’s
        difficult to imagine a world in which citizens become reënchanted with
        the media and return to trusting authority figures. “All things equal,
        the system will continue to bleed away legitimacy,” he concludes. “The
        mass extinction of stories of legitimacy leaves no margin for error, no
        residual store of public good will. Any spark can blow up any political
        system at any time, anywhere.”
      </p>
      <p>
        当拒绝知识成为一种政治行为时，社会如何运转？古里提出了一些建议，大部分旨在弥合体制与公众之间的鸿沟：比如政府机构可以利用技术变得更加透明，而心灰意冷的选民则可能对领导人能改善其生活的程度抱有更加现实的期望。然而，他这本书的主要目的并不是要解决这个问题（这问题或许根本无解）；他只是想描述这种现象。在没有某种新的巨大变革的情况下，很难想象互联网会成为一个建立共识的场所；同样也很难想象会出现这样一种世界，即公民重新对媒体着迷，并开始信任权威人物。“在其他条件相同的情况下，该体系将继续丧失合法性，”他总结道，“合法性的故事大规模灭绝，使任何失误都没有了余地，也没有了残存的公众善意。任何时候、任何地点，任何一点火星都可能引爆任何一个政治体系。”

        A decade ago, when Gurri published “The Revolt of the Public,” the
        salient change in the world of information was a startling increase in
        the number of human voices empowered to speak at once. Yuval Noah
        Harari, in his new book “Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks
        from the Stone Age to AI,” looks forward to the next few decades, when
        many of the voices we encounter online may be automated. “What we are
        talking about is potentially the end of human history,” he writes. “Not
        the end of history, but the end of its human-dominated part.” A.I.
        systems could quickly “eat the whole of human culture—everything we have
        created over thousands of years—digest it, and begin to gush out a flood
        of new cultural artifacts.” He goes on:
      </p>
      <p>
        十年前，当古里出版《公众的反抗》时，信息世界中显著的变化是突然间拥有了更多可以同时发声的人类声音。
        在其新书《纽斯：从石器时代到人工智能的信息网络简史》中，尤瓦尔·诺亚·哈拉里展望了未来几十年，届时我们在线上遇到的许多声音可能是自动化的
        。
        “我们所谈论的可能是人类历史的终结，”他写道。“不是历史的终结，而是人类主导的历史部分的终结。”
        人工智能系统可能会迅速“吞噬全部人类文化——我们在几千年里创造的一切——消化它，并开始大量产生新的文化产物。”
        他继续说道：

        We live cocooned by culture, experiencing reality through a cultural
        prism. Our political views are shaped by the reports of journalists and
        the opinions of friends. Our sexual habits are influenced by what we
        hear in fairy tales and see in movies. Even the way we walk and breathe
        is nudged by cultural traditions, such as the military discipline of
        soldiers and the meditative exercises of monks. Until very recently, the
        cultural cocoon we lived in was woven by other humans. Going forward, it
        will be increasingly designed by computers.

        我们生活在文化的蚕茧之中，通过文化的棱镜体验现实。
        我们的政治观点是由记者的报道和朋友的意见所塑造的。
        我们的性习惯受到我们在童话故事里听到的和在电影里看到的影响。
        甚至我们走路和呼吸的方式也受到文化传统潜移默化的引导，比如军人的纪律或僧侣的冥想练习。
        直到最近，我们生活的这个文化茧还是由其他人编织的；
        而从今往后，它将越来越多地由计算机来设计。

        For us to grasp where these developments might take us, Harari believes
        it’s helpful to adopt a novel definition of “information.” We’re used to
        thinking of information as being representational—that is, a piece of
        information represents reality, and might be true or false. But another
        way to look at information is to see it as a “social nexus” capable of
        putting people into “formation.” From this perspective, it doesn’t
        matter whether information is true or not. The Bible has shaped the
        course of history because the stories it contains have persuaded
        billions of people to coöperate. Bureaucratic records describe only
        limited aspects of our lives, but they have created relationships
        between governments and citizens. Taylor Swift’s songs have conjured
        Swifties out of the mass of humanity. When new information becomes
        available, new social relationships spring up.
      </p>
      <p>
        为了理解这些进展可能把我们带向何方，哈拉里认为采用一种新的“信息”定义会有所帮助。我们习惯于认为信息是表征性的
        ——
        也就是说，一条信息反映现实，并且可能是真实的，也可能是虚假的。但是，看待信息的另一种方式是将其视为一种能够将人们组织起来的“社会纽带”。从这个角度来看，信息是否真实并不重要。《圣经》塑造了历史进程，因为其中的故事说服了数十亿人进行合作。官僚记录仅描述了我们生活的某些方面，但它们在政府和公民之间建立了关系。泰勒·斯威夫特的歌曲从芸芸众生中催生出了斯威夫特粉丝。当新的信息出现时，新的社会关系就会产生。

        What will happen when A.I. systems begin pulling people into formation?
        We can get a glimpse of the possible consequences by looking at what’s
        already happened on the pre-A.I. Internet. Harari cites a 2022 study,
        conducted by the digital-intelligence firm Similarweb, which showed that
        between twenty and thirty per cent of the content on Twitter was posted
        by bots, which in turn constituted only five per cent of that platform’s
        user base. It’s no stretch to say that a platform like Twitter is in
        itself a kind of bot; its algorithms decide, in an automated fashion,
        what users should see. On such a platform, therefore, swarms of bots
        interact with a mega-bot, while human beings read and respond alongside.
        If this phenomenon were amplified—and if the bots and algorithms were
        capable of holding intelligent conversations—the likely outcome is
        “digital anarchy,” as Harari puts it. Conversations among machines will
        shape conversations about humans. “The public sphere will be flooded by
        computer-generated fake news, citizens will not be able to tell whether
        they are having a debate with a human friend or a manipulative machine,
        and no consensus will remain about the most basic rules of discussion or
        the most basic facts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        当A.I.系统开始将人们纳入阵型时，将会发生什么？我们可以通过观察在前人工智能时代互联网上已经发生的事情来一窥可能的后果。哈拉里引用了一项2022年的研究，这项研究由数字智能公司Similarweb实施，显示推特上的内容有百分之二十到三十是由机器人发布的，而这仅仅构成了该平台用户基础的百分之五。毫不夸张地说，像推特这样的平台本身就是一种机器人；其算法以自动化的方式决定用户应该看到什么。因此，在这样一个平台上，成群的机器人与一个巨型机器人互动，而人类则在一旁阅读并作出回应。如果这一现象被放大——并且这些机器人和算法能够进行智能对话——那么很有可能会出现“数字无政府状态”，用哈拉里的话说就是：机器之间的对话将塑造关于人类的对话。“公共领域将充斥着计算机生成的假新闻，公民将无法分辨他们是在与一个人类朋友还是与一台操控性机器进行辩论，对于讨论的基本规则或最基本的事实，也不会再有任何共识。”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parag" :style="{ gridTemplateColumns: gridTemplateColumns }">
      <p>
        To prepare for this possible world, Harari advocates the development of
        a robust “computer politics,” through which democratic societies might
        safeguard their public spheres. Among other things, he argues, we should
        ban the impersonation of people by computers and require A.I. systems to
        exercise a fiduciary duty toward their users. Regulatory agencies should
        be charged with evaluating the most important algorithms, and
        individuals should have a “right to an explanation” when A.I. systems
        make decisions that shape their lives. And yet he admits that, even if
        such reforms are put into place, there will be reasons to doubt “the
        compatibility of democracy with the structure of twenty-first-century
        information networks.” Democracy on a small scale is easy; it’s no
        problem for the members of a club or the residents of a small town to
        elect a new leader or mayor. But democracy on a mass scale depends on
        mass institutions—mass media, mass education, mass culture—that seem
        likely to fracture or mutate with the arrival of A.I. The forms of
        government that flourished in one info-epoch may not thrive in the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        为了应对这种可能的世界，哈拉里提倡发展稳健的“计算机政治”，通过这种方式，民主社会或许能够保护自己的公共领域。他提出，我们应该禁止计算机冒充人类，并要求人工智能系统对其用户履行受托义务。监管机构应负责评估最重要的算法，而当人工智能系统作出影响个人生活的决策时，后者应当享有“获得解释的权利”。然而他也承认，即便实施了这些改革措施，人们仍然有理由怀疑“民主是否与21世纪信息网络结构相容”。小范围内的民主是容易实现的；俱乐部成员或小镇居民选举新的领导人或市长并不是什么难事。但是大规模的民主则依赖于大规模的机构——大众媒体、大众教育、大众文化——而这些机构似乎很有可能随着人工智能的到来而出现裂痕或发生变异。在一个信息时代盛行的政府形式，在下一个信息时代未必能够繁荣。

        Call it info-determinism: the belief that the ways that information
        flows through the world are actually a kind of web in which we’re
        ensnared. One reason to take this view seriously is that it’s actually
        pretty old. In 1999, in a novel called “All Tomorrow’s Parties,” the

        dead. That history in the older sense was an historical concept. History
        in the older sense was narrative, stories we told ourselves about where
        we’d come from and what it had been like, and those narratives were
        revised by each new generation, and indeed always had been. History was

        “All Tomorrow’s Parties” was near-future science fiction: the trilogy of
        novels it concluded begins sometime around 2006. In real life, 2006 was
        the year that Twitter launched, and in which Facebook opened itself to
        people who weren’t college students and created its news feed; it was
        also the year in which Google bought YouTube, and in which Time
        magazine’s “Person of the Year” was “You”—the online individual, which,
        massed together, made for “the many wrestling power from the few.” “We
        are so ready for it,” the novelist Lev Grossman wrote, in that issue.
        “We’re ready to balance our diet of predigested news with raw feeds from
        Baghdad and Boston and Beijing. You can learn more about how Americans
        live just by looking at the backgrounds of YouTube videos—those rumpled
        bedrooms and toy-strewn basement rec rooms—than you could from 1,000
        hours of network television.” Back then, info-determinism was exciting.
        Today, it feels like a challenge which we must surmount, or else.

        《所有明日的派对》（All Tomorrow’s
        Parties）是近未来的科幻作品：它所终结的小说三部曲开始于 2006
        年左右。而在现实生活中，2006
        年正是推特启动的一年，也是脸书向非大学生开放并创建其新闻推送的一年；同年，谷歌收购了
        YouTube，而《时代》杂志的“年度人物”则是“You”——在线个人，这些个体聚合在一起，实现了“群众从少数人手中夺取权力”。小说家列夫·格罗斯曼（Lev
        Grossman）在那期杂志中写道：“我们已经做好了准备。我们已经准备好用来自巴格达、波士顿和北京的原始信息流来平衡经过预先消化的新闻。你从
        YouTube
        视频背景中了解到的美国人生活，比你看一千个小时的电视网节目还要多。”当时，信息决定论令人兴奋。如今，这感觉像是一个我们必须克服的挑战，否则就将自食恶果。
